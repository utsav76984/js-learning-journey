// Comments are used to explain code or provide additional information.

// Comments are not displayed on the browser screen or in the console.

// In JavaScript, there are two ways to add comments to code:

// - Single-Line Comments
/* - Multi-Line Comments */

// Examples:

// 1. Single-line comment example:
console.log("Hello World"); // This prints "Hello World" to the console

// 2. Multi-line comment example:
/*
Hello, my name is Shivam, and I am a software engineer.
This is an example of a multi-line comment.
